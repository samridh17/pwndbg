It has a boatload of features, see FEATURES.md or these docs. Why? Vanilla GDB is terrible to use for reverse engineering and exploit development. Typing x/g30x $esp is not fun, and does not confer much information. The year is 2020 and GDB still lacks a hexdump command! GDB's syntax is arcane and difficult to approach. Windbg users are completely lost when they occasionally need to bump into GDB. What? Pwndbg is a Python module which is loaded directly into GDB, and provides a suite of utilities and crutches to hack around all of the cruft that is GDB and smooth out the rough edges. Many other projects from the past (e.g., gdbinit , PEDA ) and present (e.g. GEF ) exist to fill some these gaps. Each provides an excellent experience and great features -- but they're difficult to extend (some are unmaintained, and all are a single 100KB , 200KB , or 300KB file (respectively)). Pwndbg exists not only to replace all of its predecessors, but also to have a clean implementation that runs quickly and is resilient against all the weird corner cases that come up. How? Installation is straightforward. Pwndbg is best supported on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 and GDB >= 9.2. git clone https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg cd pwndbg ./setup.sh If you use any other Linux distribution, we recommend using the latest available GDB built from source. Be sure to pass --with-python=/path/to/python to configure . What can I do with that? For further info about features/functionalities, see FEATURES . Who? Pwndbg is an open-source project, written and maintained by many contributors ! Want to help with development? Read CONTRIBUTING . Contact If you have any questions not worthy of a bug report , feel free to ping ebeip90 or disconnect3d at #pwndbg on Freenode and ask away.
